# mandel8
the mandelbrot set in chip-8. this renders 16 iterations at 128x64 or 64x32 depending on the version. I had to use 8-bit integers like [52525rr](https://github.com/52525rr/)'s [mandelboy](https://github.com/52525rr/mandelboy)

### there are three versions of mandel8:
mandel8: the original version made for xo-chip
<br />  mandel8-schip: version for schip
<br />  mandel8-chip8: version for the original chip-8
